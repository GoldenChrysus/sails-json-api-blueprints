# sails-json-api-blueprints
Blueprints to turn a Sails.js API into a JSON API

# Tests

Simply run `npm test`

# Thanks

This work is greatly inspired from https://github.com/mphasize/sails-generate-ember-blueprints
@mphasize did no longer actively maintain this repositiory, so I decided to fork it and to focus on JSON API compatibility.
